                            <h3>Benin is considered the birthplace of voodoo. Occult practices, including idol worship, sacrificing animals, and wearing special talismans believed to ward off evil, are widespread.</h3>
                            <p>Pastor Michel leads a small church in northern Benin. In September 2021, around 60 voodooists who live in his village arrived at the church during a service.</p>
                            <p>The occultists broke down the church door and smashed its windows. They then ordered the Christians to stop worshipping and praying. They also attacked Pastor Michel, breaking his leg.</p>
                            <p>The voodooists said if he did not stop holding church services, they would kill him.
                                Pastor Michel’s leg never fully healed, and he requires a crutch for mobility. Because he can no longer work as a farmer, he has been provided with a small mill he uses to grind crops to support his family.</p>
