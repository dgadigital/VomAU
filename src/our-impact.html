                        <p>Last year was the most impacting since 1969. What this means is that we have sent the largest amount of funds to help persecuted Christians in one year. In addition to this, we embarked upon an initiative to create awareness of the plight of persecuted believers outside of Australia. These are also countries in our region that face the same challenges from an aggressive communist Chinese government, radical Islam and secularism.</p>
                        <p>Sadly, with the state of the world today we find an even greater need for our resources as the pushback Christians face for just following Christ and His example brings with it much strife. But this is expected, as God’s Word reminds us!</p>
                        <p>Thank you for standing with us and making an impact in the lives of Christians who suffer for the gospel all over the world. While sometimes the task can seem overwhelming, we are encouraged by the testimonies of those we are able to assist in deed and prayer. In encouraging those who suffer we have seen the gospel reach many, even persecutors of Christians!</p>

                        <p>VOM’s international projects are overseen by our local contacts or are achieved in cooperation with partner ministries. These select examples have been chosen to provide an overview of how Voice of the Martyrs encouraged and assisted persecuted Christians with the help of our supporters in 2022. Many of these projects will be repeated in 2023.</p>

                        <h3>Australian Ministy</h3>
                        <p>Nearly all Christians in northeastern Nigeria have lost family members or friends in attacks by Boko Haram or Fulani Islamic militants. Entire congregations have been displaced, and many pastors have been forced to leave the region. Being active in church looks much different than it did at the beginning of the 21st century. It now takes great courage and faith to openly worship and serve Christ. Thousands of Christians remain in camps designated for internally displaced people. With few schools able to function because of the violence, families are concerned about their children’s education. Life is a constant struggle, and in some places it is difficult for Christians to find food. Famine threatens farms in the north as a result of ongoing Islamist violence; Fulani Islamic militants kill farmers when they attempt to return to their farms. In addition, many villages and farmlands have been taken over by the Islamist militias.</p>

                        <p>The church is under immense pressure in the eastern DRC. In areas controlled by the ADF, Christian villages have been raided, churches destroyed and hundreds of believers brutally killed. Dozens of local Christians have been abducted by the ADF and told to recant their faith in Christ and convert to Islam. Those abducted have witnessed horrific acts of violence against fellow Christians. Prior to the outbreak of violence, one church denomination had 25 churches in the Beni area; today they have eight. Another denomination had 54 churches and now has 11. Other denominations report similar patterns.</p>
